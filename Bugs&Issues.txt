# Sending an invalid header to the server causes the server to still expect
  a message, usually set to an unreasonable high number by the mistranslated 
  header data. Which causes the allocation of an unreasonable large buffer
  in expectance of message data.

*Possible solution(s):
 1. 	Verify that the header is within the bounds of what could be expected
    	(such as messagetypeID correctly representing an existing messagemanager),
	and lenght being within a reasonable limit.	
AND: 
	*Close the connection.
	
2.	Set a max message lenght limit.
AND:	
	*Close connection if message length exceeds that limit.
